# Spherical Latent Factor Model for Binary Data
This repo includes the implementation of spherical latent factor model for binary data https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05109.pdf.

During the implementation, we used the traditional coordinate systems https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere which has a one-to-one correspondance
with the one mentioned in the paper. The correspondance can be achieved by postprocessing.(eg., substrating the first angle by \pi and the rest of angles by 0.5\pi)
